This is a basic implementation of an Auto Configuration Server (ACS) for TR069 clients. Hopefully it will be useful for initial experiments with TR069 clients. The code actually written by me is licensed under the GPLv3 (notice that most of the files in this repository are files autogenerated by Grails)

The program is done in Groovy : http://groovy.codehaus.org/  on grails http://grails.org/


The server uses JAXB-processed schemas from: http://www.broadband-forum.org/cwmp.php 

The jar of JAXB generated classes can be got from http://github.com/andersnorgaard/groovycpe

The server can be tested with the TR069 client emulator from http://github.com/andersnorgaard/groovycpe 


Contributions welcome. Happy hacking.
